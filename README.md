# Francesco Petriglia's Data Science Portfolio
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm a data scientist with expertise in computational linguistics, natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), healthcare, and language disorders. I combine my background in psychological sciences and speech therapy with data science to create impactful solutions.

## About Me
Holding a Master's in Psychological Sciences and a Bachelor's in Speech Therapy, my career has been enriched by a strong foundation in neuropsychological rehabilitation, speech therapy, and healthcare applications of data science. Recently, I've joined a research team at the University of Udine, concentrating on the multi-level evaluation of narrative speech and applying NLP for transcript analysis. Complementing my academic and professional pursuits, I've engaged in programming courses to deepen my technical skills, particularly in Python, R, and data analysis, ensuring a robust toolkit for tackling complex data-driven challenges in healthcare.

## Projects - Computational Linguistics in Healthcare
#### Talkidz - Childhood Language Assessment
The Talkidz project is a software tool designed to automate the assessment of expressive language disorders in children, focusing on phonetic-phonological, morphosyntactic, and lexical indices. It utilizes advanced NLP techniques to analyze children's speech, offering a comprehensive evaluation of their language abilities. By quantifying phonetic-phonological accuracy, understanding morphosyntactic complexity, and assessing lexical diversity and usage, Talkidz provides a detailed insight into various aspects of language development. This tool is pivotal for researchers, clinicians, and educators, offering a reliable and efficient method for identifying language disorders early and accurately. The Talkidz software, initially crafted in Visual Basic (VB), has undergone a transformation to Python. This shift was strategically chosen to harness the capabilities of existing libraries and advanced machine learning (ML) techniques. Currently, it's transitioning further to become an online tool, enhancing accessibility and utility for a wider audience.

This work discusses the innovative use of ontologies and open data to enhance human-robot interactions, showcasing my expertise in applying advanced technologies to improve social experiences.
* Sugar, Salt & Pepper-Humanoid Robotics for Autism. A conference paper presented at the 2021 Joint ACM Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces Workshops, focusing on the application of humanoid robotics to support individuals with autism. This paper highlights my interest in leveraging technology to address complex challenges in autism therapy.

### Thesis Supervision
I have also supervised several theses that delve into the application of NLP and ML in healthcare:

* Sentiment Analysis and Natural Language Processing in the Diagnosis and Evaluation of Language Disorders in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Pilot Study. This thesis explores how sentiment analysis and NLP can be used to diagnose and evaluate language disorders, demonstrating the potential of these technologies in autism research.
* Talkidz â€“ Software for Infant Language Evaluation. Morphosyntactic Data of a Normative Sample. Supervised research focusing on the morphosyntactic analysis of child language, contributing to the development of the Talkidz software.
* Development of Quantitative Techniques and Signal and Image Analysis in Speech Therapy. This work underlines my commitment to integrating quantitative methods and technology in speech therapy, enhancing diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.
